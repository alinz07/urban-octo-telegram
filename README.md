#Horiseon Code Refactoring: Challenge 1


###**What and Why**
-This project refactors the html and css code for Horiseon's home page in order to improve accessibility. 

###**How and Why**
-Comments, semantic elements and alt text were added to improve accessibility. This will increase the potential consumer base, improve code readability, improve the websites position in search engine results (SEO) and help avoid accessibility lawsuits.
-In order to clean up the code, html classes were modified to consolidate CSS rules and some CSS rules were removed.
-HTML elements that were missing IDs were given them so that navigation links in the header will bring a consumer to the correct seciton. This also increases accessibility.

###**Things I learned**
-Html and css comments significantly increase code readability.

###**What makes this project stand out?**
-The logical flow of the html and css, the comments describing every section's code and consistent spacing make this web application beautiful.
